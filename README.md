# Dekode Maze Runner

Created for a Dekode hackathon/workshop this project is made up of a (Golang) API and four (React) apps. It provides the backend for a game called `Dekode Maze Runner` and various related tools/services, with the purpose of being used as part of a hackathon where each team creates the client for the game, then can join games and play against other teams- while people can watch via the `viewer` app.

It is automatically deployed, when `main` is tagged, to `https://maze.peterbooker.com`.
