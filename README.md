# Maze Runner

Maze Runner was created for the Dekode summer gathering in 2022, it is a (2-4 player) game with a n overall view to watch the game but without an interface for the players. Teams of programmers competed to understand the API and build an interface to the game, eventually competiting against each other in a match at the end of the day.

It can be built locally and self hosted (see the release workflow for commands), but it is hosted at [https://mazegame.dekodes.no](https://mazegame.dekodes.no) for anyone to use.

It hosts 4 separate React Apps and an API, all served by the Go program. Here is what is available once running:

* [Register](https://mazegame.dekodes.no/register)
* [Leaderboard](https://mazegame.dekodes.no/leaderboard)
* [Viewer](https://mazegame.dekodes.no/viewer)
* [Controller](https://mazegame.dekodes.no/controller) (user: controller - pass: happyhour)
